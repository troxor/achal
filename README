To recreate the environment I was testing in,

$ git clone https://github.com/troxor/achal 
$ cd achal
$ go get github.com/troxor/go-server
$ ln -s $GOPATH/src/github.com/troxor/go-server .

not really necessary, since deploy.yml pulls from github, but wouldn't hurt
$ for i in python lua; do git clone https://github.com/troxor/${i}-server ; done

Modify inventory/hosts with the machines to deploy on (I used ubuntu1404vm1, a libvirt VM on my main machine)

Dependencies:
 - Ansible (most recent versions work, the newest shiny features aren't really used here)
 - machine to deploy on has ssh key installed, for root user
